    "# Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section of the assignment, you will get to implement Support Vector Machines which are among the best (and many believe are indeed the best)“off-the-shelf” supervised learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is further divided into 3 subsections.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   In the first subsection, you will work on a synthetic dataset and visualize the boundary predicted by SVM. You will also vary the value of C-parameter and see how the decision boundary changes. **Please note that you cannot use inbuilt sklearn function for SVM in this sub-section**. You can only use a QCQP (Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program) solver like CVXPY. \n",

    "  2.   https://www.cvxpy.org/examples/basic/quadratic_program.html\n",
    "\n",
    "  Note that in this section you are expected to show how you derived the Quadratically Constrained form(which can be passed into the solver) from the basic principles of SVM algorithm\n",
    "*  In the next subsection you will use be using the famous MNIST dataset to explore various kernels and report the results. **Please note you may use inbuilt sklearn SVM functions in this subsection**\n"
